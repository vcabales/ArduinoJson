    Arduino makers can use ArduinoJson in their projects to connect multiple Arduino gadgets, or Arduinos to their web services.
    The library includes a powerful parser which can deal with nested objects (great for customising the messaging format to fit with your objectives), it is light on memory (both RAM and flash), and it has a really nice API so it’s easy to use.

    ArduinoJson library should be used as a benchmark/reference for making libraries. Truly elegant.

    It has a really elegant, simple API and it works like a charm on embedded and Windows/Linux platforms.
    We recently started using this on an embedded project and I can vouch for its quality.

    I've been watching you consistently develop this library over the past six months, and I used it today for a publish and subscribe architecture designed to help hobbyists move into more advanced robotics.
    Your library allowed me to implement remote subscription in order to facilitate multi-processor robots.

    This is a great library and I wouldn't be able to do the project I'm doing without it. I completely recommend it.

    I am just starting an ESP8266 clock project and now I can output JSON from my server script and interpret it painlessly.

    I tried <b>aJson</b> and <b>json-arduino</b> before trying your library. I always ran into memory problem after a while.
    I have no such problem so far with your library. It is working perfectly with my web services.
    Thanks Benoit for a very well polished product!
